SEMMA -> Sample Explore Modify Model Assess Conclusion

1. sample :
->Collected data from kaggle 
    as well as collected data manually to
->population is all the vehicle number plate images in the world
->the this dataset is basically a sample of that data
->No sub-sample was teken

2. Explore:
->Went to each image one by one manually
->some inappropriate or noise images were removed manually
->as well as some vehicle number plate images collected manually

3. Modify:
-> Manually went through the data and removed some inappropriate images

4. Model:
-> Created and Developed two different models
Scratch model using Keras
Yolov5 Model

5. Assess: 
Yolov5 Gives >90% accuracy
that is concluded as best model






1. Data Acqisition
->Collected data from kaggle 
    as well as collected data manually to
->population is all the vehicle number plate images in the world
->the this dataset is basically a sample of that data
->No sub-sample was teken

2. Data Munging - None

3. Data Store : 
SQLite is used as the Database for the projectwork

4. Exploratory Data Analysis: 
None

5.  Manually went trough every Data
by Data Analysis and Exploration, found some noisy images the may lead to model underfitting
->as well as some vehicle number plate images collected manually

6. Modeling 
-> Created and Developed two different models
Scratch model using Keras
Yolov5 Model

7. Implementation
Yolov5 Gives >90% accuracy
that is concluded as best model
